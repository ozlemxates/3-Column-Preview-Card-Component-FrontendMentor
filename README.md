## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding solution. This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-).  

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While doing this challange I realised body element does actually not automatically always screen size. So we need to adjust its size to properties to actually work ðŸ¥² (Sounds simple but actually not)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>The lines that help me alot</h1>
```
```css
  html, body {
      margin: 0px;
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
  }
```
### Continued development

I think it looks fine in general but I want to improve my code for media queries. Buecause I could not manage to shrink the size of <main> until 468px so it doesn't transition smoothly. But I will fix it soon!

**Thanks!** ðŸš€
